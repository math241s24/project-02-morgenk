    "text": "Reason for Choosing this Dataset\nFrom the beginning, I knew I wanted to explore something pop culture related that would also lend itself to performing text analysis. However, my primary motivation for choosing this dataset is somewhat personal. As a child, Avatar was one of my favorite shows and I have very fond childhood memories of watching it. As such, the show holds a very special place in my heart and I thought that being able to explore it in a new way would be fun and provide me with some new information regarding the show. Additionally, this dataset is quite a fun one and differs from most datasets that I have used in the past."

    "text": "Approach\nTo answer these questions, I created two shiny apps that allow users to explore the dataset. Additionally I have generated some summary statistics that allow for easy exploration of the data. To do this I first did some data wrangling which removed scene descriptions and split lines spoken by multiple characters. Then a new column called “episode” was created which assigns each episode across all seasons a corresponding number 1-61 (in the original set the numbers reset for each season). Next the data was grouped by character and episode to calculate another column called “lines” which calculates the sum of rows for each character in each episode, this allows for us to now have a numeric variable for the number of lines spoken by character. This data was then imported into a shiny app which is an interactive scatter and line plot that allows for filtering by characters, directors, and seasons. Along the x axis is the episode number (1-61) and the y axis is the line count. The same kind of app was created for IMDB exploration with IMDB score on the y axis and the character filter removed. The apps were made to allow for users to explore a wide range of available data. The plots were created using a combination of ggplot and plotly to allow for interactive line tracing and point highlighting as well as zoom features."

S Additionally the number of lines fluctuates from episode to episode with no clear observable trend.\n\n\n\nThrough looking at some characters such as Azula, Toph, and Zuko, we can pinpoint key episodes in which the character likely played a large role by looking at the line trend.\n\n\n\nCritics love ATLA. As we can see by the season breakdown of IMDB scores, the lowest rating the show ever got was a 7.1, with some of the highest ratings reaching almost a full 10 (perfect score). Additionally the director did not seem to have any direct correlation to the IMDB rating."
