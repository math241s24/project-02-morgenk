    "text": "Reason for Choosing this Dataset\nFrom the begining, I knew I wanted to explore something popculture related that would also lend itself to performing text analysis. However, my primary motivation for chosing this dataset is somewhat personal. As a child, Avatar was one of my favorite shows and I have very fond childhood memories of watching it. As such, the show holds a very special place in my heart and I thought that being able to explore it in a new way would be fun and provide me with some new information regarding the show. Additionally, this dataset is quite a fun one and differs from most datasets that I have used in the past."
