## Goals

My goal is to create a sleek and accessible website featuring a complex shiny app which allows users to explore trends across the episodes of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

## Dataset

```{r load-data}

#| echo: false 

## read data 
atla <- appa::appa
```

This project will utilize the [appa package](https://github.com/averyrobbins1/appa) by [Avery Robbins](https://github.com/averyrobbins1). This package includes a dataset containing the transcripts, writers, directors, and IMDB ratings of every episode of the early 2000s animated tv show Avatar: The Last Airbender. The dataframe includes 13,385 rows and 12 variables.

| Variable Name     | Description                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| id                | an id number for each row, essentially just a row number                |
| book              | the name of each book, or season, in the series: Water, Earth, and Fire |
| book_num          | an id number for each book, 1-3                                         |
| chapter           | the name of each chapter, or episode, in the series                     |
| chapter_num       | an id number for each chapter                                           |
| character         | every character who ever spoke in the series                            |
| full_text         | the words spoken by each character + additional scene descriptions      |
| character_words   | the words spoken by each character                                      |
| scene_description | the descriptions of what is happening on screen                         |
| writer            | the writer, or writers, for each episode                                |
| director          | the director for each episode                                           |

## Reason for Choosing this Dataset

From the beginning, I knew I wanted to explore something pop culture related that would also lend itself to performing text analysis. However, my primary motivation for choosing this dataset is somewhat personal. As a child, Avatar was one of my favorite shows and I have very fond childhood memories of watching it. As such, the show holds a very special place in my heart and I thought that being able to explore it in a new way would be fun and provide me with some new information regarding the show. Additionally, this dataset is quite a fun one and differs from most datasets that I have used in the past.

## Questions and Analysis Plan

#### Questions

-   How are lines distributed across episodes?

    -   How does it differ by character?

    -   How does it differ by season?

    -   How does it differ by director?

    -   How does it differ by character gender?

-   How doe IMDB scores change over the course of the show?

    -   What is the IMDB score average per season?

#### Project Repo Organization

-   This project repo will have 6 main files that will contain the majority of my work. Each file with the excpetion of the yml will corespond to a page on my website and address a differnt part of the project.

    -   \_quarto.yml (Website yml)

    -   index.qmd (Project Write Up)

    -   proposal.qmd (Project Proposal)

    -   presentation.qmd (Project Presentation)

    -   shiny_app.qmd (Shiny App)

    -   about.qmd (About)

-   In addition to the 6 main files, the repo will also contain a folder called EXTRA. Within EXTRA will be two additional folders.

    -   data

        -   data_cleanup.r (Code to clean up data and create cleaned data files)

        -   atla.rda (Cleaned Up Data rda)

        -   atla.csv (Cleaned Up Data csv)

    -   shinyapp

        -   app.r (Shiny App Creation Code)

-   Within the repo, another folder called images will also be used to store any images used on the site.

-   The repo will also contain other necessary files for creating a website using quarto but these will remain untouched.
