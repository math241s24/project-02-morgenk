This package includes a dataset containing the transcripts, writers, directors, and IMDB ratings of every episode of the early 2000s animated tv show Avatar: The Last Airbender. The dataframe includes 13,385 rows and 12 variables.\n\n| Variable Name     | Description                                                             |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| id                | an id number for each row, essentially just a row number                |\n| book              | the name of each book, or season, in the series: Water, Earth, and Fire |\n| book_num          | an id number for each book, 1-3                                         |\n| chapter           | the name of each chapter, or episode, in the series                     |\n| chapter_num       | an id number for each chapter                                           |\n| character         | every character who ever spoke in the series                            |\n| full_text         | the words spoken by each character + additional scene descriptions      |\n| character_words   | the words spoken by each character                                      |\n| scene_description | the descriptions of what is happening on screen                         |\n| writer            | the writer, or writers, for each episode                                |\n| director          | the director for each episode                                           |\n| imdb_rating       | imdb ratings on a scale of 1 to 10                                      |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Reason for Choosing this Dataset\n\nFrom the beginning, I knew I wanted to explore something pop culture related that would also lend itself to performing text analysis. However, my primary motivation for choosing this dataset is somewhat personal. As a child, Avatar was one of my favorite shows and I have very fond childhood memories of watching it. As such, the show holds a very special place in my heart and I thought that being able to explore it in a new way would be fun and provide me with some new information regarding the show. Additionally, this dataset is quite a fun one and differs from most datasets that I have used in the past.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Questions and Analysis Plan\n\n#### Questions\n\n-   How are lines distributed across episodes?\n\n    -   How does it differ by character?\n\n    -   How does it differ by season?\n\n    -   How does it differ by director?\n\n    -   How does it differ by character gender?\n\n-   How doe IMDB scores change over the course of the show?\n\n    -   What is the IMDB score average per season?\n\n#### Project Repo Organization\n\n-   This project repo will have 6 main files that will contain the majority of my work. Each file with the excpetion of the yml will corespond to a page on my website and address a differnt part of the project.\n\n    -   \\_quarto.yml (Website yml)\n\n    -   index.qmd (Project Write Up)\n\n    -   proposal.qmd (Project Proposal)\n\n    -   presentation.qmd (Project Presentation)\n\n    -   shiny_app.qmd (Shiny App)\n\n    -   about.qmd (About)\n\n-   In addition to the 6 main files, the repo will also contain a folder called EXTRA. Within EXTRA will be two additional folders.\n\n    -   data\n\n        -   data_cleanup.r (Code to clean up data and create cleaned data files)\n\n        -   atla.rda (Cleaned Up Data rda)\n\n        -   atla.csv (Cleaned Up Data csv)\n\n    -   shinyapp\n\n        -   app.r (Shiny App Creation Code)\n\n-   Within the repo, another folder called images will also be used to store any images used on the site.\n\n-   The repo will also contain other necessary files for creating a website using quarto but these will remain untouched.\n\n#### Plan of Attack - Weekly Plan\n\n-   Week 1\n\n    -   create all necessary files (shiny app folder, data clean up folder, and additional qmd file)\n\n    -   submit project proposal (April 4th)\n\n-   Week 2\n\n    -   peer review proposal (April 8th)\n\n    -   amend proposal following peer reveiew\n\n    -   clean up dataset\n\n    -   complete shiny app creation\n\n    -   implement shiny app into quarto file\n\n-   Week 3\n\n    -   peer review code (April 15th)\n\n    -   amend code following peer reveiew\n\n    -   create presentation of project\n\n-   Week 4\n\n    -   present project ( April 25th/27th)\n\n    -   amend project following presentation feedback\n\n-   Week 5\n\n    -   begin project write up\n\n-   Week 6\n\n    -   completre project write up\n\n    -   submit project write up (May 9th)\n",
