This package includes a dataset containing the transcripts, writers, directors, and IMDB ratings of every episode of the early 2000s animated tv show Avatar: The Last Airbender. The dataframe includes 13,385 rows and 12 variables.\n\n| Variable Name     | Description                                                             |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| id                | an id number for each row, essentially just a row number                |\n| book              | the name of each book, or season, in the series: Water, Earth, and Fire |\n| book_num          | an id number for each book, 1-3                                         |\n| chapter           | the name of each chapter, or episode, in the series                     |\n| chapter_num       | an id number for each chapter                                           |\n| character         | every character who ever spoke in the series                            |\n| full_text         | the words spoken by each character + additional scene descriptions      |\n| character_words   | the words spoken by each character                                      |\n| scene_description | the descriptions of what is happening on screen                         |\n| writer            | the writer, or writers, for each episode                                |\n| director          | the director for each episode                                           |\n| imdb_rating       | imdb ratings on a scale of 1 to 10                                      |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Reason for Choosing this Dataset\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Questions and Analysis Plan\n\n-   How are lines distrubuted across episodes\n\n-   \n\n-   A one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation. Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here.\\\n    \\\n\n    -   If using particular dataset(s), a brief description of each dataset including the reason why you chose the particular dataset, its dataset, its dimensions and any other relevant metadata. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\n\n    -   If answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.\n\n-   A weekly “plan of attack” outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.\n\n-   The final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a README.md in each folder explaining what goes in there.\n",
